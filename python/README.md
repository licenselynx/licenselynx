# LicenseLynx for Python

To use License Lynx in Python, you can call the ``map`` method from the ``LicenseLynx`` module to map a license name to its canonical form.

## Usage

```python
from LicenseLynx import LicenseLynx

# Map the license name
canonical_name = LicenseLynx.map("licenseName")
print(canonical_name)
```
